### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Harsh and I am currently an SRE at Apple, developing infrastructure that powers Siri.

I enjoy server management, building web-apps, writing command line tools in Python and Go to automate managing these apps in the cloud.

My interests lie in infrastructure as code and systems development.
