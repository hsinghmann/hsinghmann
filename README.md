### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Harsh and I am currently an SRE at Smartsheet, working towards creating a continuous integration and continuous delivery process to ensure that the applications are delivered and monitored effectively across different regions including US, US-Gov and EU.

I enjoy server management, building web-apps, writing command line tools in Python and Go to automate managing these apps in the cloud.

My interests lie in infrastructure as code and systems development.
